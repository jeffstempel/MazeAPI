# MazeAPI
MazeAPI Solution

Pull the code and run with Visual Studio.
You can use PostMan to post to the API endpoint: localhost:8080/solvemaze?maze=(insert maze here)
There is a bug so right now the first puzzle is hard-coded into the code behind.
Solution as of right now loads the maze into memory and finds the starting point.
